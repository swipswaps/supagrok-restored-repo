Subject: Automate GitHub Upload via GitHub CLI for Odoo Modules
Customer: Your Company
Module: Custom Development / Version Control Integration
Priority: Medium
Description

We require a one-shot script to automate the upload of an Odoo module’s code to GitHub using the GitHub CLI (gh). The script must:

    Enforce strict error handling.

    Validate that gh is installed and authenticated.

    Automatically create the repo (if it doesn’t exist) with the provided visibility and description.

    Push the current directory contents to the specified branch.

    Provide real-time, human-readable status messages in the terminal.

This will streamline our Odoo development workflow by eliminating manual Git steps.
Steps to Reproduce

    Prepare a local Odoo module directory with your code.

    Ensure the GitHub CLI (gh) is installed and you’ve run gh auth login.

    Execute the attached script with the repository identifier:

    bash upload_to_github.sh owner/repo

    Observe automated repository creation and code push.

Proposed Solution

Attached is upload_to_github.sh, a self-contained bash script that meets the above requirements. It uses only gh (not plain git) and emits all output to the terminal.
Attachment: upload_to_github.sh
