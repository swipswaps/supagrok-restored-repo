# Step-by-Step Supabase Docker Compose Fix

This guide breaks down the fix process into smaller, manageable steps to resolve the Supabase Docker Compose issues.

## Step 1: Ensure Required Directories and Files Exist

First, make sure all necessary directories and configuration files are present:

```bash
./fix_directories.sh
```

This script will:
- Create all required directories (volumes/storage, volumes/pooler, etc.)
- Create essential configuration files like vector.yml
- Ensure database SQL init files exist

## Step 2: Fix YAML Structure Issues

Next, fix the YAML structure in docker-compose.yml:

```bash
./fix_yaml_structure.sh
```

This script addresses the specific error:
```
ERROR: The Compose file './docker-compose.yml' is invalid because:
services.studio.depends_on contains an invalid type, it should be an array, or an object
```

By creating a simplified but correctly formatted docker-compose.yml file.

## Step 3: Test with Minimal Services

After fixing the YAML structure, start with just the database:

```bash
docker-compose up -d db
```

Wait about 15 seconds for the database to initialize, then check its status:

```bash
docker-compose ps db
```

If the database is healthy, you can proceed to start vector:

```bash
docker-compose up -d vector
```

## Step 4: Continue Adding Services Incrementally

Once the core services are running, add more services:

```bash
# Start analytics
docker-compose up -d analytics

# Wait ~5 seconds
sleep 5

# Start the rest of the services
docker-compose up -d
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues at any step:

1. Check service logs:
   ```bash
   docker logs supabase-db
   docker logs supabase-vector
   ```

2. Ensure volumes have proper permissions:
   ```bash
   chmod -R 755 volumes/
   ```

3. Verify .env variables have correct values, especially:
   - POSTGRES_HOST should be "db"
   - All passwords and keys should be properly set

## Why This Approach Works

Breaking down the solution into smaller steps helps:
1. Identify exactly where the problem occurs
2. Fix issues one at a time
3. Build a working system incrementally
4. Avoid complex circular dependencies

This is a known strategy for handling complex Docker Compose setups with multiple interdependent services.
