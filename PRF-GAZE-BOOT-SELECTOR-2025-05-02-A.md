# PRF‑GAZE‑BOOT‑SELECTOR‑2025‑05‑02‑A

## Directive Purpose
Create a gaze-controlled boot selector for GRUB and rEFInd boot managers, allowing users to select boot options using eye tracking.

## Status
✅ PRF‑COMPLIANT (P01–P28)

## Scope
- Detect available boot options from GRUB and rEFInd configurations
- Create a user-friendly interface for selecting boot options
- Implement gaze tracking with dwell selection
- Provide visual feedback for gaze position and selection progress
- Ensure smooth and stable selection to solve jumpiness issues

## Features

### Boot Option Detection
- Automatically detects available boot options from GRUB and rEFInd configurations
- Falls back to default options if detection fails
- Assigns appropriate icons to different types of boot options

### Gaze Tracking Integration
- Connects to the WebSocket server to receive gaze data
- Implements smoothing to reduce jumpiness
- Provides visual feedback of gaze position
- Uses dwell selection for stable option selection

### User Interface
- Clean, high-contrast interface for better visibility
- Large buttons for easier selection
- Visual progress indicator for dwell selection
- Fullscreen mode for distraction-free operation

### Configuration Management
- Saves and loads configuration from file
- Configurable dwell time, dwell radius, and smoothing factor
- Command-line options for easy customization

## Usage

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Tkinter (usually included with Python)
- WebSocket client library: `pip install websocket-client`
- Running gaze tracking system (gaze_ws_server.py)

### Running the Boot Selector

```bash
# Start the WebSocket server (if not already running)
python3 gaze_ws_server.py

# Start the boot selector with default settings
python3 gaze_boot_selector.py

# Start with custom settings
python3 gaze_boot_selector.py --dwell-time 1.5 --dwell-radius 40 --smoothing 0.6

# Save configuration to file
python3 gaze_boot_selector.py --dwell-time 1.5 --dwell-radius 40 --smoothing 0.6 --save-config
```

### Using the Boot Selector

1. The boot selector will display available boot options as large buttons
2. Look at the desired boot option
3. Keep your gaze on the option until the progress indicator completes (dwell time)
4. The selected option will be highlighted and activated
5. Press Escape or 'q' to exit the selector

## Integration with Existing Components

The Gaze Boot Selector integrates with the existing components:

1. **WebSocket Server (gaze_ws_server.py)**:
   - Connects to the WebSocket server to receive gaze data
   - Uses the same data format and protocol

2. **GRUB and rEFInd Configuration**:
   - Reads configuration files to detect available boot options
   - Respects the existing configuration structure

## Solving Jumpiness Issues

The Gaze Boot Selector addresses jumpiness issues through several mechanisms:

1. **Smoothing**: Implements configurable smoothing to reduce jitter in gaze position
2. **Dwell Selection**: Requires sustained gaze on an option before selection, preventing accidental selections
3. **Dwell Radius**: Allows for small movements within a radius without resetting the dwell timer
4. **Large Buttons**: Provides larger targets that are easier to focus on
5. **Visual Feedback**: Shows gaze position and selection progress for better user control
