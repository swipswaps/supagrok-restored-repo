# Gaze Tracking System

**Directive**: PRF‑DOCS‑GAZE‑TRACKING‑2025‑05‑02‑A  
**Purpose**: Documentation for Gaze Tracking System components  
**Status**: ✅ PRF‑COMPLIANT (P01–P28)

## Overview

The Gaze Tracking System provides a comprehensive solution for eye tracking and calibration. It uses WebGazer.js for browser-based eye tracking and provides tools for displaying and processing gaze data.

## Components

### gaze_ws_server.py

This script runs a WebSocket server that receives gaze data from the browser and makes it available to other components. It acts as a bridge between the web interface and the desktop applications.

#### Features

- Listens for WebSocket connections on port 8765
- Receives gaze data from the browser
- Processes and validates gaze data
- Makes gaze data available to other components
- Handles errors gracefully

#### Usage

```bash
# Start the WebSocket server
python3 gaze_ws_server.py
```

### overlay_gaze_logger.py

This script displays gaze data as an overlay on the screen. It shows where the user is looking and can be used for debugging and visualization.

#### Features

- Connects to the WebSocket server to receive gaze data
- Displays gaze data as an overlay on the screen
- Shows blink detection
- Provides visual feedback for calibration
- Handles threading issues correctly

#### Usage

```bash
# Start the overlay logger
python3 overlay_gaze_logger.py
```

### index.html

This is the web interface for calibration and gaze tracking. It uses WebGazer.js to track the user's gaze and sends the data to the WebSocket server.

#### Features

- Initializes WebGazer.js for eye tracking
- Provides a calibration interface
- Sends gaze data to the WebSocket server
- Shows visual feedback for calibration
- Handles errors gracefully

#### Usage

1. Start an HTTP server:
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```

2. Open the web interface in your browser:
   ```bash
   firefox http://localhost:8000/index.html
   ```

## Launch Scripts

The repository includes launch scripts to simplify starting the system:

### launch_gaze.sh

This script starts the gaze tracking components:

```bash
# Start the gaze tracking components
./launch_gaze.sh
```

### launch_all.sh

This script starts all components, including the rEFInd configuration tools:

```bash
# Start all components
./launch_all.sh
```

## Calibration

Calibration is a critical step for accurate gaze tracking. The web interface provides a calibration procedure that you should follow before using the system.

### Calibration Procedure

1. Open the web interface in your browser
2. Look at each calibration point and click on it
3. Repeat for all calibration points
4. Verify calibration by looking at different parts of the screen

### Tips for Better Calibration

- Ensure good lighting conditions
- Position yourself at a comfortable distance from the screen
- Keep your head relatively still during calibration
- Use a webcam with good resolution and frame rate
- Calibrate periodically for best results

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Visualization

You can customize the overlay visualization by modifying the `overlay_gaze_logger.py` script. For example, you can change the color and size of the gaze point:

```python
# Custom visualization settings
GAZE_POINT_COLOR = (0, 255, 0)  # Green
GAZE_POINT_SIZE = 20  # Larger point
```

### Data Logging

You can log gaze data for later analysis by adding a logging function to the WebSocket server:

```python
# Add to gaze_ws_server.py
def log_gaze_data(data):
    with open("gaze_data.csv", "a") as f:
        f.write(f"{time.time()},{data['x']},{data['y']},{data['blink']}\n")
```

### Integration with Other Applications

You can integrate the gaze tracking system with other applications by connecting to the WebSocket server and receiving gaze data:

```python
# Example client code
import websocket
import json

def on_message(ws, message):
    data = json.loads(message)
    print(f"Gaze point: ({data['x']}, {data['y']}), Blink: {data['blink']}")

ws = websocket.WebSocketApp("ws://localhost:8765",
                            on_message=on_message)
ws.run_forever()
```

## Performance Considerations

The gaze tracking system can be resource-intensive, especially when running at high frame rates. Here are some tips for optimizing performance:

- Reduce the frame rate if you don't need high temporal resolution
- Close other applications to free up CPU and memory
- Use a dedicated GPU if available
- Adjust the resolution of the webcam feed
- Consider using a more powerful computer for demanding applications

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **WebSocket Connection Failed**: Make sure the WebSocket server is running and accessible.

2. **Webcam Not Found**: Check that your webcam is connected and working properly.

3. **Poor Tracking Accuracy**: Recalibrate the system and ensure good lighting conditions.

4. **High CPU Usage**: Reduce the frame rate or resolution of the webcam feed.

5. **Browser Compatibility**: Use a modern browser that supports WebGazer.js (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

### Debugging

You can enable debug logging in the WebSocket server by setting the `DEBUG` flag:

```python
# Set DEBUG to True for verbose logging
DEBUG = True
```

## PRF Compliance

All components in the gaze tracking system are fully compliant with PRF requirements P01-P28, including:
- Proper metadata and UUID generation
- Comprehensive logging for traceability
- Proper error handling
- Thread safety
- Performance optimization
