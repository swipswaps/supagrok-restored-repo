# rEFInd Boot Manager Configuration

**Directive**: PRF‑DOCS‑REFIND‑CONFIG‑2025‑05‑02‑A  
**Purpose**: Documentation for rEFInd Boot Manager Configuration components  
**Status**: ✅ PRF‑COMPLIANT (P01–P28)

## Overview

The rEFInd Boot Manager Configuration system provides tools for managing rEFInd boot manager configurations through a user-friendly approach. Instead of directly editing system configuration files, you can edit files in your home directory and then sync them to the system.

## Components

### prf_refind_gui_auto_create.py

This script automatically creates and populates the `~/.config/refind_gui` directory with configuration files needed for rEFInd boot manager customization. It ensures that all necessary configuration files are properly seeded from system configurations or created as blank templates if system files are not accessible.

#### Features

- Creates the `~/.config/refind_gui` directory if it doesn't exist
- Seeds configuration files from system locations when available
- Creates blank configuration files as fallback when system files are not accessible
- Verifies all required files are created successfully
- Logs all operations for traceability
- Handles errors gracefully with appropriate fallbacks

#### Usage

```bash
# Run with regular user permissions (may not access system files)
python3 prf_refind_gui_auto_create.py

# Run with elevated permissions (recommended for full functionality)
sudo python3 prf_refind_gui_auto_create.py
```

### prf_refind_desktop_sync.py

This script synchronizes the configuration files in the `~/.config/refind_gui` directory with the system configuration files. It creates backups of the system files before making changes and ensures that all operations are performed safely.

#### Features

- Syncs configuration files from `~/.config/refind_gui` to system locations
- Creates backups of system files before making changes
- Verifies that all files are synced correctly
- Logs all operations for traceability
- Handles errors gracefully with appropriate fallbacks

#### Usage

```bash
# Run with elevated permissions (required to modify system files)
sudo python3 prf_refind_desktop_sync.py
```

## Configuration Files

The rEFInd Boot Manager Configuration system manages the following configuration files:

1. **theme.conf**: Controls the appearance of the rEFInd boot manager
   - System location: `/boot/efi/EFI/refind/theme/theme.conf`
   - GUI location: `~/.config/refind_gui/theme.conf`

2. **icons.conf**: Defines the icons used in the rEFInd boot manager
   - System location: `/boot/efi/EFI/refind/theme/icons/entries.conf`
   - GUI location: `~/.config/refind_gui/icons.conf`

3. **main.conf**: Main configuration file for the rEFInd boot manager
   - System location: `/boot/efi/EFI/refind/refind.conf`
   - GUI location: `~/.config/refind_gui/main.conf`

## Workflow

The typical workflow for customizing the rEFInd boot manager is as follows:

1. Run `prf_refind_gui_auto_create.py` to create and populate the `~/.config/refind_gui` directory
2. Edit the configuration files in the `~/.config/refind_gui` directory
3. Run `prf_refind_desktop_sync.py` to sync the changes to the system configuration files
4. Reboot to see the changes in the rEFInd boot manager

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Permission Denied**: If you encounter permission denied errors, make sure you're running the scripts with sudo.

2. **Missing System Files**: If the system files don't exist, the scripts will create blank configuration files. You'll need to manually configure them.

3. **Sync Failures**: If the sync fails, check the log files for more information. The most common cause is permission issues.

### Log Files

Both scripts create log files in the `/tmp` directory with timestamps. You can check these logs for detailed information about what happened during execution.

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Themes

You can create custom themes for the rEFInd boot manager by editing the `theme.conf` file. Here's an example of a custom theme:

```
# Custom theme configuration
banner themes/custom/banner.png
selection_big themes/custom/selection_big.png
selection_small themes/custom/selection_small.png
font themes/custom/font.png
```

### Custom Icons

You can create custom icons for the rEFInd boot manager by editing the `icons.conf` file. Here's an example of custom icons:

```
# Custom icons configuration
icons/os_linux.png Linux
icons/os_windows.png Windows
icons/os_macos.png macOS
```

### Boot Options

You can configure boot options by editing the `main.conf` file. Here's an example of custom boot options:

```
# Custom boot options
timeout 5
use_graphics_for linux,windows
```

## PRF Compliance

Both scripts are fully compliant with PRF requirements P01-P28, including:
- Proper metadata and UUID generation
- Comprehensive logging for traceability
- Proper error handling
- Backup creation before making changes
- Verification of operations
