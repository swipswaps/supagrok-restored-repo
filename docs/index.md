# Supagrok Documentation

**Directive**: PRF‑DOCS‑MAIN‑2025‑05‑02‑A  
**Purpose**: Main documentation for Supagrok components  
**Status**: ✅ PRF‑COMPLIANT (P01–P28)

## Overview

Supagrok is a comprehensive system that includes:

1. **rEFInd Boot Manager Configuration**: Tools for managing rEFInd boot manager configurations
2. **Gaze Tracking System**: Components for eye tracking and calibration

This documentation provides detailed information about each component, how to set it up, and how to use it.

## Components

### rEFInd Boot Manager Configuration

The rEFInd Boot Manager Configuration system consists of two main scripts:

1. **prf_refind_gui_auto_create.py**: Creates and populates the `~/.config/refind_gui` directory with configuration files
2. **prf_refind_desktop_sync.py**: Syncs the GUI configs with the system configs

These scripts allow you to customize your rEFInd boot manager through configuration files in your home directory, which are then synchronized with the system configuration.

### Gaze Tracking System

The Gaze Tracking System consists of several components:

1. **gaze_ws_server.py**: WebSocket server for receiving gaze data from the browser
2. **overlay_gaze_logger.py**: Displays gaze data as an overlay
3. **index.html**: Web interface for calibration and gaze tracking

These components work together to provide a complete eye tracking solution that can be used for various applications.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- WebSocket client library: `pip install websocket-client`
- Access to the Supagrok repository

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/swipswaps/supagrok.git
   cd supagrok
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install websocket-client numpy opencv-python
   ```

### Running the System

#### rEFInd Boot Manager Configuration

1. Create and populate the `~/.config/refind_gui` directory:
   ```bash
   sudo python3 prf_refind_gui_auto_create.py
   ```

2. Sync the GUI configs with the system configs:
   ```bash
   sudo python3 prf_refind_desktop_sync.py
   ```

#### Gaze Tracking System

1. Start the WebSocket server:
   ```bash
   python3 gaze_ws_server.py
   ```

2. Start the HTTP server:
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```

3. Start the overlay logger:
   ```bash
   python3 overlay_gaze_logger.py
   ```

4. Open the web interface in your browser:
   ```bash
   firefox http://localhost:8000/index.html
   ```

Alternatively, you can use the provided launch scripts:
```bash
./launch_gaze.sh
```

Or to launch all components:
```bash
./launch_all.sh
```

## Testing

The repository includes comprehensive tests for all components:

1. Basic functionality tests:
   ```bash
   python3 test_refind_config_simple.py
   python3 test_gaze_tracking.py
   ```

2. Edge case tests:
   ```bash
   python3 test_edge_cases.py
   ```

3. Performance tests:
   ```bash
   python3 test_performance.py
   ```

4. Run all tests:
   ```bash
   ./run_tests.sh
   ```
