# Testing Framework

**Directive**: PRF‚ÄëDOCS‚ÄëTESTING‚Äë2025‚Äë05‚Äë02‚ÄëA  
**Purpose**: Documentation for Supagrok Testing Framework  
**Status**: ‚úÖ PRF‚ÄëCOMPLIANT (P01‚ÄìP28)

## Overview

The Supagrok Testing Framework provides comprehensive testing for all components of the Supagrok repository. It includes basic functionality tests, edge case tests, and performance tests, all with full PRF compliance.

## Test Components

### Basic Functionality Tests

#### test_refind_config_simple.py

This script tests the basic functionality of the rEFInd boot manager configuration scripts. It creates a controlled test environment with simulated system paths and verifies that the scripts perform their operations correctly.

#### test_gaze_tracking.py

This script tests the basic functionality of the gaze tracking system components. It verifies that the WebSocket server, overlay logger, and web interface work correctly individually and together.

### Edge Case Tests

#### test_edge_cases.py

This script tests edge cases and error conditions for all components. It verifies that the system handles malformed data, high frequency data, missing files, and invalid requests gracefully.

### Performance Tests

#### test_performance.py

This script tests the performance of all components under various conditions. It measures throughput, latency, and resource usage to ensure that the system performs well under load.

### Test Runner

#### run_tests.sh

This script runs all tests in sequence and reports the results. It ensures that all tests are run in a clean environment and that any failures are properly reported.

## Running Tests

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- WebSocket client library: `pip install websocket-client`
- Access to the Supagrok repository

### Basic Functionality Tests

```bash
# Test rEFInd boot manager configuration
python3 test_refind_config_simple.py

# Test gaze tracking system
python3 test_gaze_tracking.py
```

### Edge Case Tests

```bash
# Test edge cases and error conditions
python3 test_edge_cases.py
```

### Performance Tests

```bash
# Test performance under various conditions
python3 test_performance.py
```

### All Tests

```bash
# Run all tests in sequence
./run_tests.sh
```

## Test Results

Test results are logged to files in the `/tmp` directory with timestamps. You can check these logs for detailed information about what happened during test execution.

### Example Log Files

- `/tmp/refind_config_test_<timestamp>.log`: rEFInd configuration test log
- `/tmp/gaze_tracking_test_<timestamp>.log`: Gaze tracking system test log
- `/tmp/edge_cases_test_<timestamp>.log`: Edge case test log
- `/tmp/performance_test_<timestamp>.log`: Performance test log
- `/tmp/supagrok_test_<timestamp>.log`: Combined test log

### Performance Reports

Performance test results are also saved to a JSON file:

- `/tmp/performance_report_<timestamp>.json`: Performance test results in JSON format

This file contains detailed metrics for each performance test, including throughput, latency, and resource usage.

## CI/CD Integration

The testing framework is integrated with CI/CD pipelines through GitHub Actions. The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` and includes:

- Running tests on multiple Python versions
- Linting and formatting checks
- Building and deploying documentation

### GitHub Actions Workflow

```yaml
name: PRF-CI-CD-PIPELINE-2025-05-02-A

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, master, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, master, develop ]

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.8, 3.9, '3.10', '3.11']

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install websocket-client numpy opencv-python
    - name: Run tests
      run: |
        ./run_tests.sh
```

## Writing New Tests

When writing new tests, follow these guidelines to ensure PRF compliance:

1. Include proper metadata and UUID generation
2. Use the log utility for traceability
3. Create a controlled test environment
4. Clean up the test environment after testing
5. Handle errors gracefully
6. Include a PRF compliance table

### Example Test Structure

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

LOGFILE = Path(f"/tmp/example_test_{TS}.log")

# === [P02] Log utility ===
def log(msg):
    with open(LOGFILE, "a") as f:
        f.write(f"{datetime.now()} ‚ñ∂ {msg}\n")
    print(msg)

# === [P03] Test function ===
def test_example():

    # Test code here
    return True

# === [P04] Entrypoint ===

    log(f"üöÄ Starting Example Test")
    
    try:
        # Run test
        success = test_example()
        
        # Report results
        if success:
            log(f"‚úÖ Test passed")
        else:
            log(f"‚ùå Test failed")
        
        log(f"‚úÖ UUID: {UUID}")
        log(f"üìú Log: {LOGFILE}")
        
        # Print PRF compliance information
        log(f"üîí PRF‚ÄëTEST‚ÄëEXAMPLE‚Äë2025‚Äë05‚Äë02‚ÄëA: COMPLIANT (P01-P28)")
        
    except Exception as e:
        log(f"‚ùå Test failed with error: {e}")
        sys.exit(1)
