# PRF‑TEST‑PLAN‑2025‑05‑01‑A

## Directive Purpose
Provide a comprehensive testing plan for the Supagrok repository, focusing on the rEFInd boot manager configuration and gaze tracking system components. This plan ensures that all components are tested with full PRF compliance.

## Status
✅ PRF‑COMPLIANT (P01–P28)

## Scope
- Test rEFInd boot manager configuration scripts
- Test gaze tracking system components
- Verify integration between components
- Ensure all tests are PRF-compliant

## Components to Test

### 1. rEFInd Boot Manager Configuration

#### Scripts
- `prf_refind_gui_auto_create.py`: Creates and populates the `~/.config/refind_gui` directory
- `prf_refind_desktop_sync.py`: Syncs the GUI configs with the system configs

#### Test Cases
1. **Directory Creation**: Verify that `prf_refind_gui_auto_create.py` creates the `~/.config/refind_gui` directory if it doesn't exist
2. **Config File Seeding**: Verify that `prf_refind_gui_auto_create.py` seeds the directory with configuration files
3. **Error Handling**: Verify that `prf_refind_gui_auto_create.py` handles errors gracefully
4. **Config Syncing**: Verify that `prf_refind_desktop_sync.py` syncs the GUI configs with the system configs
5. **Backup Creation**: Verify that `prf_refind_desktop_sync.py` creates backups before making changes
6. **Error Handling**: Verify that `prf_refind_desktop_sync.py` handles errors gracefully

### 2. Gaze Tracking System

#### Components
- `gaze_ws_server.py`: WebSocket server for receiving gaze data from the browser
- `overlay_gaze_logger.py`: Displays gaze data as an overlay
- `index.html`: Web interface for calibration and gaze tracking
- Various other components for mouse control, dwell activation, etc.

#### Test Cases
1. **WebSocket Server**: Verify that `gaze_ws_server.py` starts and listens on the correct port
2. **Gaze Data Processing**: Verify that `gaze_ws_server.py` receives and processes gaze data correctly
3. **Overlay Display**: Verify that `overlay_gaze_logger.py` displays gaze data correctly
4. **Threading Safety**: Verify that `overlay_gaze_logger.py` handles threading issues correctly
5. **Web Interface**: Verify that `index.html` loads and initializes WebGazer
6. **WebSocket Communication**: Verify that `index.html` sends gaze data to the WebSocket server
7. **Integration**: Verify that all components work together correctly
8. **Error Handling**: Verify that the system handles errors gracefully

## Test Scripts

### 1. rEFInd Boot Manager Configuration Test

**File**: `test_refind_config.py`

**Purpose**: Test rEFInd boot manager configuration scripts with full PRF compliance

**Features**:
- Creates a controlled test environment with simulated system paths
- Tests `prf_refind_gui_auto_create.py` functionality
- Tests `prf_refind_desktop_sync.py` functionality
- Verifies that all operations are performed correctly
- Cleans up the test environment after testing

### 2. Gaze Tracking System Test

**File**: `test_gaze_tracking.py`

**Purpose**: Test gaze tracking system components with full PRF compliance

**Features**:
- Tests `gaze_ws_server.py` functionality
- Tests `overlay_gaze_logger.py` functionality
- Tests HTTP server and web interface
- Tests integration between all components
- Manages test processes and ensures cleanup

## Test Execution

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- WebSocket client library: `pip install websocket-client`
- Access to the Supagrok repository

### Running the Tests

1. **rEFInd Boot Manager Configuration Test**:
   ```bash
   python3 test_refind_config.py
   ```

2. **Gaze Tracking System Test**:
   ```bash
   python3 test_gaze_tracking.py
   ```

### Test Results

Test results will be logged to:
- `/tmp/refind_config_test_<timestamp>.log` for rEFInd boot manager configuration tests
- `/tmp/gaze_tracking_test_<timestamp>.log` for gaze tracking system tests

Each test will report:
- Whether each component passed or failed
- Detailed information about any failures
- A summary of all test results

## PRF Compliance

Both test scripts are fully compliant with PRF requirements P01-P28, including:
- Proper metadata and UUID generation
- Comprehensive logging for traceability
- Controlled test environments
- Thorough testing of all components
- Proper error handling
- Cleanup of test environments

## Integration with CI/CD

These tests can be integrated into a CI/CD pipeline to ensure that all components continue to work correctly as changes are made to the codebase.

Example CI/CD configuration:
```yaml
test:
  script:
    - python3 test_refind_config.py
    - python3 test_gaze_tracking.py
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - /tmp/refind_config_test_*.log
      - /tmp/gaze_tracking_test_*.log
```

## Conclusion

This test plan provides a comprehensive approach to testing the Supagrok repository with full PRF compliance. By executing these tests, we can ensure that all components work correctly individually and together, and that the system handles errors gracefully.
