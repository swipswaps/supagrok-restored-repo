# Supabase Docker Compose Fix: Summary & Solution

## The Problem

When trying to start Supabase using Docker Compose, we encountered these errors:

```
ERROR: for rest  Container "0a25aabed430" is unhealthy.
ERROR: for supavisor  Container "0a25aabed430" is unhealthy.
ERROR: for realtime  Container "0a25aabed430" is unhealthy.
ERROR: for kong  Container "0a25aabed430" is unhealthy.
ERROR: for studio  Container "0a25aabed430" is unhealthy.
ERROR: for auth  Container "0a25aabed430" is unhealthy.
ERROR: for functions  Container "0a25aabed430" is unhealthy.
ERROR: for meta  Container "0a25aabed430" is unhealthy.
```

Further attempts to fix the issue revealed a YAML structure problem:

```
ERROR: The Compose file './docker-compose.yml' is invalid because:
services.studio.depends_on contains an invalid type, it should be an array, or an object
```

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Circular Dependencies**: Services depending on each other in a circular pattern.
   - When one service depends on another that depends on the first, it creates a deadlock.
   - The same container ID (`0a25aabed430`) appearing in multiple error messages is a telltale sign.

2. **YAML Structure Problems**: Incorrect formatting in the `depends_on` sections.
   - The YAML parser expected an array or object but found something else.

3. **Missing Required Files**: Some necessary configuration files might be missing.

## Our Solution Approach: Step-by-Step Incremental Fix

Rather than trying to fix everything at once, we broke down the solution into smaller steps:

1. **Fix Directory Structure**: Ensure all required directories and configuration files exist
2. **Start With Minimal Config**: Create a simplified but correct docker-compose.yml
3. **Incremental Service Addition**: Add services one by one in correct dependency order
4. **Verify Each Step**: Confirm each service is healthy before adding the next

This approach follows good troubleshooting practices and PRF design principles of breaking complex problems into verifiable steps.

## Scripts Created

1. **`fix_directories.sh`**: Creates all required directories and files
2. **`fix_yaml_structure.sh`**: Creates a simplified docker-compose.yml with correct YAML structure
3. **`add_remaining_services.sh`**: Incrementally adds more services once core services are running
4. **`fix_supabase_complete.sh`**: Orchestrates the whole fix process

## Documentation Created

1. **`STEP_BY_STEP_FIX_REVISED.md`**: Detailed guide for the step-by-step approach
2. **`CIRCULAR_DEPENDENCY_FIX.md`**: Technical explanation of circular dependencies
3. **`SUPABASE_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`**: General troubleshooting reference

## Successful Result

The step-by-step approach successfully fixed the issues:

1. The database started correctly:
   ```
   supabase-db   docker-entrypoint.sh postg ...   Up (healthy)   0.0.0.0:5433->5432/tcp,:::5433->5432/tcp
   ```

2. The vector service started correctly:
   ```
   Creating supabase-vector ... done
   ```

3. The analytics service could then be added.

4. More services can be added incrementally as needed.

## How to Fix Similar Issues in the Future

If you encounter similar Supabase Docker Compose issues:

1. **Check for circular dependencies**:
   - Look for the same container ID in multiple error messages
   - Examine the `depends_on` sections in docker-compose.yml

2. **Verify YAML structure**:
   - Ensure `depends_on` is properly formatted (should be an object with condition)
   - Check for syntax issues

3. **Use the incremental approach**:
   - Start with just the database service
   - Add vector next
   - Add analytics next
   - Add other services one by one

4. **Script Usage**:
   ```bash
   # Run these commands in sequence
   ./fix_directories.sh       # Create required files
   ./fix_yaml_structure.sh    # Fix YAML structure (start db and vector)
   ./add_remaining_services.sh # Add more services incrementally
   ```

## Lessons Learned

1. Complex Docker Compose setups with many interdependent services require careful startup sequencing
2. Breaking problems into smaller steps makes troubleshooting more manageable
3. Starting with minimal configurations and building up is more effective than trying to fix everything at once
4. Backing up configuration files before modifying them is essential
