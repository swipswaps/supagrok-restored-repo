# PRF‑FEATURE‑ENHANCEMENTS‑2025‑05‑02‑A

## Directive Purpose
Enhance the Supagrok repository with new features for the rEFInd boot manager configuration and gaze tracking system components.

## Status
✅ PRF‑COMPLIANT (P01–P28)

## Scope
- Add mouse control functionality to the gaze tracking system
- Add theme generation capabilities to the rEFInd boot manager configuration
- Ensure all new features are fully PRF-compliant
- Provide comprehensive documentation for the new features

## Feature Enhancements

### 1. Gaze Mouse Control

#### File: `gaze_mouse_control.py`

**Purpose**: Control the mouse cursor with gaze tracking, enabling hands-free computer interaction.

**Features**:
- Connects to the WebSocket server to receive gaze data
- Moves the mouse cursor based on gaze position
- Implements dwell clicking for hands-free clicking
- Provides configurable smoothing, dwell time, and dwell radius
- Saves and loads configuration from file
- Provides command line interface for configuration

**Usage**:
```bash
# Start gaze mouse control with default settings
python3 gaze_mouse_control.py

# Start with custom settings
python3 gaze_mouse_control.py --smoothing 0.5 --dwell-time 1.5 --dwell-radius 40

# Save configuration to file
python3 gaze_mouse_control.py --smoothing 0.5 --dwell-time 1.5 --dwell-radius 40 --save-config
```

### 2. rEFInd Theme Generator

#### File: `refind_theme_generator.py`

**Purpose**: Generate custom themes for the rEFInd boot manager, providing a more personalized boot experience.

**Features**:
- Creates theme directories and files
- Generates banner image with custom text
- Generates selection images with custom colors
- Generates basic icons for operating systems and functions
- Creates theme.conf and icons.conf files
- Saves theme settings to JSON file for later editing
- Provides command line interface for configuration
- Syncs theme to system using prf_refind_desktop_sync.py

**Usage**:
```bash
# Generate theme with default settings
python3 refind_theme_generator.py

# Generate theme with custom settings
python3 refind_theme_generator.py --name mytheme --bg-color "#000000" --sel-color "#FF0000" --text-color "#FFFFFF"

# Load settings from JSON file
python3 refind_theme_generator.py --settings mytheme_settings.json

# Generate theme and sync to system
python3 refind_theme_generator.py --sync
```

## Integration with Existing Components

### Gaze Mouse Control Integration

The gaze mouse control component integrates with the existing gaze tracking system by:
- Connecting to the WebSocket server (gaze_ws_server.py)
- Receiving and processing gaze data
- Providing an additional way to interact with the computer using gaze tracking

### rEFInd Theme Generator Integration

The rEFInd theme generator integrates with the existing rEFInd boot manager configuration by:
- Creating theme files in the ~/.config/refind_gui directory
- Updating the theme.conf and icons.conf files to include the custom theme
- Using prf_refind_desktop_sync.py to sync the theme to the system

## PRF Compliance

Both new components are fully compliant with PRF requirements P01-P28, including:
- Proper metadata and UUID generation
- Comprehensive logging for traceability
- Proper error handling
- Configuration management
- Integration with existing components

## Testing

The new components can be tested using the existing testing framework:

### Gaze Mouse Control Testing

```bash
# Test basic functionality
python3 test_gaze_tracking.py

# Test edge cases
python3 test_edge_cases.py

# Test performance
python3 test_performance.py
```

### rEFInd Theme Generator Testing

```bash
# Test basic functionality
python3 test_refind_config_simple.py

# Test edge cases
python3 test_edge_cases.py

# Test performance
python3 test_performance.py
```

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation for the new features is provided in the following files:
- `docs/index.md`: Overview of all components
- `docs/gaze_tracking.md`: Documentation for gaze tracking system, including mouse control
