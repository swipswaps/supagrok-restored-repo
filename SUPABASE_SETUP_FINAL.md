# Supabase Setup - Final Status

## What We've Fixed

1. **Fixed Directory Structure**:
   - Created missing directories: volumes/storage, volumes/pooler, volumes/functions
   - Added required configuration files

2. **Database Setup**:
   - Fixed PostgreSQL configuration with postgresql.conf
   - Created required database roles (supabase_admin, authenticator, etc.)
   - Database container is now running properly

3. **Environment Variables**:
   - Updated POSTGRES_HOST from 'localhost' to 'db'
   - Added placeholder values for missing variables

4. **Circular Dependencies**:
   - Removed circular dependency between services

5. **Docker Socket Issues**:
   - Fixed docker.sock mount path in the docker-compose.yml

## Current Status

The following services are running:
- **supabase-db**: PostgreSQL database (Healthy)
- **supabase-analytics**: Analytics service (Starting)
- **supabase-vector**: Vector service (Having permission issues with Docker socket access)

## What's Still Missing

The current docker-compose.yml only includes 3 services, whereas a complete Supabase setup typically includes:
- Studio (Admin UI)
- Kong (API Gateway)
- Auth (Authentication service)
- REST (PostgREST API)
- Realtime (WebSocket service)
- Storage (File storage)
- ImgProxy (Image processing)
- Meta (Metadata service)
- Functions (Edge functions)
- Supavisor (Connection pooler)

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Services Setup**:
   - Add the missing services to the docker-compose.yml
   - You can find a complete Supabase docker-compose.yml template at the [official Supabase GitHub repository](https://github.com/supabase/supabase)

2. **Fix Vector Service**:
   - The vector service has permission issues with Docker socket access
   - This may require running Docker with different permissions or adjusting the vector.yml configuration

3. **Verify with Supabase Studio**:
   - Once all services are running, access Supabase Studio at http://localhost:8000
   - Confirm that you can create tables, manage authentication, etc.

## Quick Start

To use the existing partial setup:

1. Run the fix script:
   ```bash
   ./fix_supabase_complete.sh
   ```

2. Verify running services:
   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```

3. Connect to the database:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it supabase-db psql -U postgres
   ```

To get a complete Supabase setup, consider using the official Supabase Docker Compose template and then applying our fixes to address the specific issues encountered.
